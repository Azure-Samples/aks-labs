# AKS-LABS

Grab and go resources to learn about Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The labs are organized by topic and are designed to be hands-on, with step-by-step instructions.

## Getting Started

There are a couple of ways to get started with the labs.

1. You can run the [Setting Up the Lab Environment](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/getting-started/setting-up-lab-environment)

2. You can run the [Kubernetes the Easy Way with AKS Automatic](https://azure-samples.github.io/aks-labs/docs/getting-started/aks-automatic)

In either case, you will wind up a AKS cluster running in Azure on which you can run any of the labs.
