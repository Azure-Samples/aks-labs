## Cleanup

To clean up the resources created in this lab, run the following command to delete the resource group. If you want to use the resources again, you can skip this step.

```bash
az group delete \
--name ${RG_NAME} \
--yes \
--no-wait
```

This will delete the resource group and all its contents.
