### Setup Resource Group

In this workshop, we will set environment variables for the resource group name and location.

:::danger Important

The following commands will set the environment variables for your current terminal session. If you close the current terminal session, you will need to set the environment variables again.

:::

To keep the resource names unique, we will use a random number as a suffix for the resource names. This will also help you to avoid naming conflicts with other resources in your Azure subscription.

Run the following command to generate a random number.

```bash
RAND=$RANDOM
export RAND
echo "Random resource identifier will be: ${RAND}"
```

Set the location to a region of your choice. For example, `eastus` or `westeurope` but you should make sure this region supports [availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/availability-zones-overview).

```bash
export LOCATION=eastus
```

Create a resource group name using the random number.

```bash
export RG_NAME=myresourcegroup$RAND
```

:::tip

You can list the regions that support availability zones with the following command:

```bash
az account list-locations \
--query "[?metadata.regionType=='Physical' && metadata.supportsAvailabilityZones==true].{Region:name}" \
--output table
```

:::

Run the following command to create a resource group using the environment variables you just created.

```bash
az group create \
--name ${RG_NAME} \
--location ${LOCATION}
```
